# Bookstore-Shopping-Cart
###Java II Project 2

Chapter 13 Programming Challenge 5 problem statement:

Create an application that works like a shopping cart system for a bookstore. 
Your application will use a text file named BookPrices.txt that will contain 
the names and prices of various books, formatted in the following fashion:
 
	I Did It Your Way, 11.95
	The History of Scotland, 14.50
	Learn Calculus in One Day, 29.95
	Feel the Stress, 18.50

Each line in the file contains the name of a book, followed by a comma, followed by the book's retail price.
When your applications begins execution, it should read the contents of the file and store the book titles in a list component.
The user should be able to select a title from the list and add it to a shopping cart, which is simply another list component.
The application should have buttons or menu items that allow users to remove items from the shopping cart, clear the shopping
cart of all selections, and check out. When the user checks out, the application should calculate and display the subtotal of all
the books in the shopping cart, the sales tax (which is 6% of the subtotal), and the total.

This was our first GUI project for the second Java class.

Still unsure how to upload eclipse projects to github, so hopefully this will suffice.
